# MinerAirlines-System
This version represents the final iteration of Programming Assignment 4 for Advanced Object-Oriented Programming â€“ Spring 2023. 

In this assignment, our objective was to develop a system for MinerAir, tasked with storing and modifying flight information based on a given flight ID number. The system, implemented individually, extracts data from a specified file and enables users to modify various flight details, including origin airport, origin code, destination airport, destination code, departure date, departure time, first-class price, business class price, and main cabin price. Notably, changes to the departure date or time trigger corresponding adjustments to the arrival date or time. The system also tracks and generates a report of all modifications. Additionally, we were assigned to incorporate a customer purchasing system, allowing employees/managers to make changes to flights.

In terms of functionality, the RunFlight main class orchestrates the execution of essential methods within the MinerAirlines-System folder, providing a user-friendly interface for customers and employees to interact with the MinerAirlines System. Distinct use cases are defined for customers and employees, with employees having the added capability to purchase tickets. This object-oriented programming project encapsulates an airport system, utilizing separate Java files to represent aspects such as international/domestic flights, customers, and employees. The system allows users to log in, view flights, purchase tickets, cancel tickets, cancel flights, modify flight information, and run an auto-purchasing system. The project simulates an airport system, with room for future enhancements. Detailed information about each method is available in the 'doc' folder within the JavaDoc documentation.
