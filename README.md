# MinerAirlines-System

This is my final version of my programming assignment 4 for Advanced Object-Oriented Programming â€“ Spring 2023. This work was done individually and completely on my own. 
I did not share, reproduce, or alter any part of this assignment for any purpose. I did not share code, upload this assignment online in any form, or view/received/modified
code written from anyone else. All deliverables were produced entirely on my own. This assignment is part of an academic course at The University of Texas at El Paso 
and a grade will be assigned for the work I produced.

@version 4.0 The RunFlight main class is responsible for running all necessary methods withing the MinerAirlines-System folder. the system provides a user friendly 
interface for the customer/employee to access the MinerAirlines System. Each the customer and the employee have different use cases on
how to use the system; however, the employy may still purchase tickets.

This project uses object-oriented programming to represent an airport system, each java file is reponsible for representing a certain aspect of an airline such as an international/domestic
flight or a cusomer/employee. The system can be used to log in as a customer or employee who which each of them have different user interfaces. The customer can view flight, purchase a flight
ticket, or they can cancel a ticket. The employee can do the same fuctionalities as the customer, but they can can cancel a flight, modify flight information, and run the auto-purchasing system.

This project is intended to simulate an airport system as much as possible, modifications can still be added to implove the system. All other inforamtion about a method of each file can be 
found in the JavaDoc folder named 'doc'.
